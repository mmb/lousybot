IRC bot written in node.js.

The goal for this bot is to make it easy to write plugins that are thin
wrappers around forked child processes that communicate with IRC through UNIX
standard streams (stdin, stdout, stderr). This allows plugins to use any
existing UNIX command-line tool or language instead of reinventing the wheel.

This bot has been developed on a private server with non-malicious users. Use
it in the wild on IRC at your own risk.
